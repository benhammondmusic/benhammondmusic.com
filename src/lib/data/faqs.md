                <dd>I often augment my performance by incorporating live-looping, vocal percussion, and various effects. The result is a fun, improvised, multi-layered orchestration including percussion, bass, rhythm and lead guitars, and vocal harmonies, custom built every time. I am also a composer and arranger of music, and my family has operated Maine lumber mills for generations.</dd>

These options are available on most of <a href="booking.html">my packages</a>. Also, like a DJ, I am able to construct on-the-fly "mashups" and extended mixes, transitioning between multiple songs to keep the music flowing.</dd>

                <dd>No, most of my performances are not on a stage; the closer to the dance floor the better! I thrive on audience participation and an intimate connection with the listeners; I honestly find a giant stage can take away from that connection. However, we do require an finished surface to set up on, so depending on the venue a small stage might be a great fit.</dd>

                <dd>Yes, but some important caveats: all musicians will need complete protection from direct sun and from precipitation. We also may not be able to perform in extremely cold weather; having a backup indoor performance space is always recommended, particularly in Colorado's unpredictable environment.</dd>

                <dd>Yes. For 3hr gigs, generally two 15 minute breaks or one 30 minute break. We are quite flexible, and can schedule any breaks to coordinate with the event timeline. There will be DJ music playing during breaks, to keep the energy flowing throughout the event.</dd>

            <div>
                <dd>It's possible, for an extra cost. However, the later we stay, the longer the cleanup crew has to wait. We will not play later than the alloted venue time, and will do our best to respect the time of everyone involved.</dd>
                <dd>I've started offering late-night DJ sets, where we can keep music going after the band finishes. Cheaper than extending with the whole band, this can also cue your crowd that the night is winding down, while still keeping the dance floor pumping.</dd>

                <dd>In over 15 years I have cancelled precisely zero weddings due to illness. However, I have a strong and supportive network of professional musicians nationwide whom I trust to fill in on short notice. I also work closely with several event DJs who would be able to provide top-notch musical entertainment when needed. In any case, your balance would be adjusted accordingly, and the show would go on!</dd>

                <dd>Though my deposit retainers are contractually non-refundable, I have offered to fully refund all 2020 events impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic as needed. Many clients are choosing to elope or have intimate ceremonies this year, and are rescheduling their full party for 2021. I am very supportive of this, and recommend impacted couples choose a backup date NOW. I also recommend people considering a 2021 event start booking their vendors ASAP, as the season will fill-up quickly.</dd>

He played mine and my husbands song while I walked down the isle, and then played a lesser known song we threw at him last minute after we were married. It was truly great!"

			"text": "He is so talented!!! When we found out he did weddings we were totally stoked! He gave us so many options (like adding band members and instruments) in a convenient online form. We decided to add a drummer for a little something extra and it was perfect! When we looked at all of our wedding photos everyone was having so much fun singing and dancing. Ben really enjoys what he does and it really brings the fun into his crowd! Thank you Ben & Mike!"

Ben exceeded our expectation in every single way. He was so much fun. He played to the crowd, had great energy and just blew us away ... We genuinely could not have asked for better music at our wedding. Incredible!"

He was so helpful in the communication beforehand – picking out songs, understanding the flow of the day, etc. He is an extremely talented musician and we were so excited to have our friends and family get to listen to him play! He knows the perfect songs to play for all the right moods, and does great mashups between songs too! ... Everyone needs to hire him ASAP!! Thank you so much Ben!!"

Not only did he provide great music for the ceremony, his dance tunes really got everyone moving ...  Ben is a great talent and a nice guy as well. It was a pleasure and an honor to have him add his special touch to our daughter's wedding day!"

			"text": "Ben is a class act from start to finish. We went to see one of Ben’s local shows on a referral to see what we thought of him performing for our small back yard wedding. Ben has a wonderful voice and is a very talented musician with a gift for “mash ups”, looping and improvisation that keeps the audience engaged from beginning to end ... People around our neighborhood have even come by and told us how much they enjoyed listening to him. We are so grateful we met Ben, he made our day more than amazing!"

All of our guests raved to us about how good the music was after. Ben was also super easy to work with and made the whole process a breeze. I would highly, highly recommend! Don’t even think about getting a dj."

He is truly a talented musician and was without a doubt the highlight of the night. From the ceremony, to the reception, Ben understood exactly how to set the mood and enhance the experience. Our event wouldn't have been the same without him. We simply couldn't recommend him more. Thank you Ben for making our special event that much more amazing!"

Loud enough to hear, but did not ever feel you had to shout over it ... He ALWAYS had a smile on his face. Ben was a joy to work with. Thank you for your impeccable level of service and your exceptional musical talent. I love your gravelly voice too."

He was able to take classic songs and add a fun new twist to them while catering the style of the playing to the specific parts of our wedding... He played with two other talented musicians and the atmosphere at the wedding was warm and inviting. Ben was extremely easy to work with and is a fun person to be around. He plays live all around Colorado and is definitely worth seeing if he stops by your neck of the woods! Ben is awesome!"

Ben was so easy and nice to work with from the initial contact to the contract signing and day of set up. In the chaos of weddings it was so nice having that be an easy thing. I would recommend Ben to anyone that wants live music. Another fun thing was that he helped keep the kids entertained which was a huge help. Thank you Ben for everything!!!"

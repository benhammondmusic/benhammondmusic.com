			As a solo artist, I specialize in destination- and other intimate events in the state and
			around the globe. Often incorporating loop pedals and extended performance techniques, I truly
			enjoy providing the energy and variety of a full band or DJ with the pricing and space
			considerations of a single performer. If a larger, more intricate production is in your plans,
			I work with an amazing assortment of band members including horns, strings, percussion, and
			much more.
		</p>

		<p class="mx-auto w-full max-w-4xl py-2">
			My performances are improvised and passionate, shaping themselves in real-time to suit you and
			your guests, whether that be a romantic ceremony, relaxing over cocktails, or dancing the
			night away! My services are well suited for clients who are passionate about live music, and
			who are seeking a fun and memorable way to enhance their celebration. Wherever you might be in
			your planning, please reach out by email for more info. Let's make some music!

		As a solo artist, I specialize in destination- and other intimate events in the state and around
		the globe. Often incorporating loop pedals and extended performance techniques, I truly enjoy
		providing the energy and variety of a full band or DJ with the pricing and space considerations
		of a single performer. If a larger, more intricate production is in your plans, I work with an
		amazing assortment of band members including horns, strings, percussion, and much more.
	</p>

	<p class="py-2">
		My performances are improvised and passionate, shaping themselves in real-time to suit you and
		your guests, whether that be a romantic ceremony, relaxing over cocktails, or dancing the night
		away! My services are well suited for clients who are passionate about live music, and who are
		seeking a fun and memorable way to enhance their celebration. Wherever you might be in your
		planning, please reach out by email for more info. Let's make some music!

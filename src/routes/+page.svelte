		"Funky… guitar-looping, beat-boxing, soul-singing… powerhouse Ben Hammond" (Sarasota Herald
		Tribune) performs a wide range of groove-oriented acoustic mashups, original compositions and
		re-imagined cover songs.
	</p>

	<p class="py-2">
		For over two decades, Hammond has honed his diverse, energetic style and is consistently one of
		the most sought after musicians in those places he's called home, including most recently the
		Colorado Rocky Mountains and Front Range. As noted by the Portland Press Herald: "Hammond is a
		versatile musician who writes memorable originals, delivers when he decides to cover someone,
		and uses his guitar, voice and gadgets to create a sound that you want to keep hearing."
